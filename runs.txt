    sloped sides, wavey, hydrostatic, no rbcs.   Idea is to see lateral friction slow gyre.

these all developed a strong gyre.  I think that is aphyscial, and the problem is that the
receiving basin isn't that big.

Has 40 more y grids just to have a big downstream basin.  Its about 40 km wide.  Physics in there isn't very good
but should not be of interest.  The other alternative is sea surface nudging....

The problem is aphysical behaviour with grid-scale noise, particularly in the receiving basin.  Is this poorly resolved baroclinic instability?
Do I need variable viscosity to smooth things out in there?  Turn rbcs back on?

   wavy sides, no rbcs, big downstream basin.   Leith viscosity on top of background.  Supposed to eat up gridscale noise, and may make soln in
   big basin more reasonable, and hence not leak weird turbulence into the test basin.  Other possibilities include variable horizontal viscosity
   so that it just damps the small scale response out there.
