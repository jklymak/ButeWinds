    sloped sides, wavey, hydrostatic, no rbcs.   Idea is to see lateral friction slow gyre.

these all developed a strong gyre.  I think that is aphyscial, and the problem is that the
receiving basin isn't that big.

Running 36187770  Bute3d06  jklymak  R 2-00:09:24      1 cdr2294

Has 40 more y grids just to have a big downstream basin.  Its about 40 km wide.  Physics in there isn't very good
but should not be of interest.  The other alternative is sea surface nudging....

The problem is aphysical behaviour with grid-scale noise, particularly in the receiving basin.  Is this poorly resolved baroclinic instability?
Do I need variable viscosity to smooth things out in there?  Turn rbcs back on?

36303483 Bute3d07
   wavy sides, no rbcs, big downstream basin.   Leith viscosity on top of background.  Supposed to eat up gridscale noise, and may make soln in
   big basin more reasonable, and hence not leak weird turbulence into the test basin.  Other possibilities include variable horizontal viscosity
   so that it just damps the small scale response out there.

   Went to NaN.  Plotting now

36369789 Bute3d08
   as above, but dt = 4s versus 6; hopefully stays stable.  Wind only blows for 4 days, not 10

- I should probably switch to not telescoping so soon.
- in 3D it definitely ventilates to deeper, if we believe the response in the big basin?

The mean flow problem is a bit strange because it sets up a definite sea-surface expression, and that then depends
on the holding basin.  This is a surface wave, so its pretty hard to make the basin long enough to absorb.  The only
way to really eliminate would be with SSH nudging.  We could make the receiving basin wider (in y) 40 km is still
pretty small, but that starts getting computationally expensive for something that we dont' care about.

Does receiving basin matter?  Maybe I'm wrong and should just be using rbcs?


36783111 Bute3d09
   - base case - 5 day burst, no heat forcing
   - made receiving basin larger, slightly larger dz, 96 nodes.  Made receiving basin rougher as well.
   Seems to do a good job of killing most KE in the basin.
   36873905 New run
   COMPLETED

36851449  Bute3d10
   - 5 day burst, yes heat forcing
   - setp as above, but with negative heat flux.
   - wnet unstable.  Prob need smaller dt...
   - new run 3s 36873
   - new run 2s 36905241 = unstable 3.3125 d
      - not clear what is wrong here - its hydrostatic so maybe that is a problem?  CFL seems fine...
   - 36909734: tryig with NH.  left at dt=2s...
      - CFL still fine, still dying at 3.3125 d.
   - 36918939: back to 3s, nonHydrostatic=.FALSE. but starting ealier?   Prob should look at a snap




36851987 Bute3d11
   - no heat flux 8-d burst
   - unstable around 289800 = 13.4 days...
   - 3s 36908786  unstable same time.  Must be wave hitting edge
   - 2s 36911431

36851935 Bute3d12
   - no heat flux 3-d burst
   - Still running, almost done

   - 37084886

37191918 Bute3d16

37193031 Bute3d17
   - 0.225 N/m^2 (12.5 m/s), but f=0.71e-4 lat = 30
   - Died early CFL

37193100 Bute3d18
   - 0.225 N/m^2 (12.5 m/s), but f=1.2e-4 lat = 60

37195592 Buete3d19
   Constant Nsq = 3.44 e-4.  Temperature advection is on, but it is passive (tAlpha=0)
   I should check this one before running any more stratifications.

37203346 Buete3d20
   Back to variable Nsq (I hope).  f=0.

37316729 Bute3d21
   - Nsq=0.5 of base Nsq

37316768 Bute3d22
   - Nsq=2.0 of base Nsq

37745767 Bute3d23
   - Nsq constant =  Nsq0=0.000344
   - constant wind forcing from begining.  Goal here is to get the time dependence.
   Does the depth asymptote or does it keep getting deeper?

37746015 Bute3d24
   - Nsq constant =  Nsq0=0.000344 * 2

37746132 Bute3d25
   - Nsq constant =  Nsq0=0.000344 / 2

40054007 Bute3d27
   - same as Bute3d23, but with momentum diagnostics.

50046951 Bute3d28
   - same as Bute3d27, but with f=0.  Time series shows that changing f doesn't
   change the timing, but 3-d runs are very different (I assume).
   Issue with this rn is that it _still_ has some N/S assymetry

Skiped Bute3d29

50220744 Bute3d03
- as above, but symmetric receiving basin

50220995 Bute3d31
- as above w f=0

 Bute3d32 50528434
- OK, still has assymetry.  Then realized I was probably
putting the wind in incorrectly!  Should be fixed.  Made the basins symmetric just in case.
May not need such a massive basin.  This run has f=0.  Turned off Leith, adv schems=77, dt = 10 s.
Definitely much better!  But have to back to dt=4.  Went unstable.  Seems to be working with 4 s.
Could maybe do 6 s, but...

 Bute3d33 50573016
- As above f=1e-4

Bute3d34
- With sponge BC.  Didn't matter so removed....

## Good runs (finally!, mostly...)
### 100 km/h winds...

Bute3d35 51625481
As above no sponge.  Temperature set to 0 in inlet 10 > 100 km.  This is meant to be a tracer
of exchange into the inlet
- mysteriously just hung at beginning of run...

Bute3d36 51554309
- As above, 2 * Nsq0

Bute3d37 51632659
- As above, Nsq0 / 2

### Wrong wind forcing: don't use

Bute3d38 51860701
- tau = 0.225

Bute3d39 51860705
- tau = 0.4

### Fixed wind forcing

Bute3d40 52501941
 - tau = 0.1 (10 m/s)

Bute3d41 52501945
- tau = 0.225 (15 m/s)

Bute3d42 52505624
 - tau = 0.4 (20 m/s)

### Resdtart from 3days
Bute3d42Stop3d
 - tau = 0.4 (20 m/s)
 - as above, but winds stop after three days...

### Real stratification Steady
Bute3d43 58741920
- running again because I wasn't forcing wind...
- 20 m/s wind

Bute3d43Stop5d 60172281
- as above, but with wind turned off after day 5

   meant to be wind all the way across.
