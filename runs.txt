    sloped sides, wavey, hydrostatic, no rbcs.   Idea is to see lateral friction slow gyre.

these all developed a strong gyre.  I think that is aphyscial, and the problem is that the
receiving basin isn't that big.

Has 40 more y grids just to have a big downstream basin.  Its about 40 km wide.  Physics in there isn't very good
but should not be of interest.  The other alternative is sea surface nudging....

The problem is aphysical behaviour with grid-scale noise, particularly in the receiving basin.  Is this poorly resolved baroclinic instability?
Do I need variable viscosity to smooth things out in there?  Turn rbcs back on?

   wavy sides, no rbcs, big downstream basin.   Leith viscosity on top of background.  Supposed to eat up gridscale noise, and may make soln in
   big basin more reasonable, and hence not leak weird turbulence into the test basin.  Other possibilities include variable horizontal viscosity
   so that it just damps the small scale response out there.

   Went to NaN.  Plotting now

   as above, but dt = 4s versus 6; hopefully stays stable.  Wind only blows for 4 days, not 10

- I should probably switch to not telescoping so soon.
- in 3D it definitely ventilates to deeper, if we believe the response in the big basin?

The mean flow problem is a bit strange because it sets up a definite sea-surface expression, and that then depends
on the holding basin.  This is a surface wave, so its pretty hard to make the basin long enough to absorb.  The only
way to really eliminate would be with SSH nudging.  We could make the receiving basin wider (in y) 40 km is still
pretty small, but that starts getting computationally expensive for something that we dont' care about.

Does receiving basin matter?  Maybe I'm wrong and should just be using rbcs?

   - base case - 5 day burst, no heat forcing
   - made receiving basin larger, slightly larger dz, 96 nodes.  Made receiving basin rougher as well.
   Seems to do a good job of killing most KE in the basin.

   - 5 day burst, yes heat forcing
   - setp as above, but with negative heat flux.
   - wnet unstable.  Prob need smaller dt...
   - new run 3s 36873
   - new run 2s 36905241 = unstable 3.3125 d
      - not clear what is wrong here - its hydrostatic so maybe that is a problem?  CFL seems fine...
   - 36909734: tryig with NH.  left at dt=2s...
      - CFL still fine, still dying at 3.3125 d.
   - 36918939: back to 3s, nonHydrostatic=.FALSE. but starting ealier?   Prob should look at a snap
